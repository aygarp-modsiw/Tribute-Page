          Spencer Reid was born on October 12, 1981 to

            >Diana Reid</a

          his father left him and his mother as he could no longer deal with her
          paranoid

            target="_blank"
            >other things</a
          >. Reid once mentioned that he was a victim of bullying in school
          where he was stripped naked and tied to a goalpost in front of other
          students. After waiting for all the other teenagers to leave, he
          walked home, only to find that his mother had not noticed he was so
          late to return because she had been having one of her schizophrenic
          episodes ("<a
            href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Elephant%27s_Memory"
            target="_blank"
            >Elephant's Memory</a
          >"). Reid grew up learning nearly everything he knows from books, with
          his mother (a college professor of 15th-century literature) often
          reading to him. Still, Reid knew that the way his mother was living
          wasn't healthy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When he was eighteen, he had Diana placed in a mental institution.
          Until
          <a
            href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Season_Twelve"
            target="_blank"
            >Season Twelve</a
          >, she resided in that same mental institution and Reid had stated
          that he sent letters to Diana every day because of the guilt he felt
          for not visiting her. Reid is also worried about the fact that his
          mother's illness can be passed on genetically; he once told Morgan
          that "I know what it's like to be afraid of your own mind".
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Reid has an eidetic memory, meaning that he can remember an
          exceedingly large amount of information with extraordinary detail.
          This, however, only definitely applies to information gathered
          visually (especially things he's read, as implied with the word
          eidetic). However, his ability to retain auditory information has been
          rather inconsistent, as evident when he once noted he could not
          remember

            target="_blank"
            >Tabula Rasa</a
          >"). Despite that, he has been able to perfectly recite speech he
          hears, even when it was in a completely different language of which he
          didn't speak a word ("<a
            href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Coraz%C3%B3n"

          Reid is noted for his social awkwardness and prodigal brilliance,
          which draws on his analytical way of thinking and establishes him as
          the encyclopedic brainiac of the group. He has an affinity for words -
          from reading and scrutinizing texts at an astounding 20,000 words per
          minute (an average American adult reads text at 200–300 words per
          minute) and his rambling of long explanations and tangents (prompting
          <a
            href="https://criminalminds.fandom.com/wiki/Derek_Morgan"
            target="_blank"
            >Morgan</a
          >
          and other team members to have to tell him to be quiet). He tends to
          miss social cues at times (for example, unknowingly changing the
          subject of a conversation).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Reid also had a hard time feeling empathy, among other emotions, until
          after the events of season two, stating that he could understand what
          the victims felt before they died to Morgan in "<a

            target="_blank"

            target="_blank"
            >Matthew Gray Gubler</a
          >
          has also commented on the differences between Reid and similarly odd
          character Garcia: "She represents everything he is not, she is very
          tech oriented and I would like to imagine he is more like 1920s smart,
          books and reading etc." Reid is a technophobe and does not use either
          email or the new iPads. Gubler tweeted that Reid is also germaphobic.

          On par with bring an eccentric genius with trouble at conforming to
          social behavior, the show has hinted at symptoms correlated with
          schizophrenia, (minor) autism, and Asperger's Syndrome, as evident by
          his bursts of long-winded commentary, his impressive academic history
          (three PhDs in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Engineering) in a short
          amount of time, and adverse reactions when touched by strangers. It is
          speculated that he may also have slight
